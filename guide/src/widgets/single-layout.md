# Single-widget Layout

Widgets in this section have a primary purpose of performing some layout
functionality on a single child widget. To use one of these layout widgets with
multiple widgets, first lay out the widgets using one of the [multi-widget
layout widgets](./multi-layout.md).

The widgets in this category are:

- [Align](./layout/align.md): Aligns its child relative to its parent's edges.
- [Collapse](./layout/collapse.md): Shows/hides its child.
- [Container](./layout/container.md): Visually contains a child. Useful for
  grouping related content visually.
- [Expand](./layout/expand.md): Resizes its child to occupy as much space as
  available.
- [Resize](./layout/resize.md): Restricts its child's size to be within a range
  of widths and/or heights.
