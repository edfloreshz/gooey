# Multi-Widget Layout

Widgets in this section have a primary purpose of performing some layout
functionality on a collection of widgets. These currently are:

- [Grid](./layout/grid.md): A 2D grid where each cell is a widget.
- [Layers](./layout/layers.md): A Z-direction stack of widgets.
- [Stack](./layout/stack.md): A 1D grid of either rows or columns.
- [Wrap](./layout/wrap.md): Widgets are laid out horizontally, wrapping into
  multiple rows if needed.
