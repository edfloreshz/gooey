# Button

The [`Button`][button] widget is an interactive widget that offers an `on_click`
callback when it is pressed. It has multiple visual styles, allowing it to be
used as a basis of many button-like widgets. The built-in widgets that utilize a
`Button` to create a specialized button type are:

- [Checkbox](./checkbox.md)
- [Radio](./radio.md)
- [Select](./select.md)
