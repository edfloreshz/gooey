# About Cushy

Cushy is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) crate for the [Rust programming
language][rust]. It runs natively utilizing [wgpu][wgpu] to render
consistently-styled, cross-platform applications using hardware acceleration
when available. It does not utilize any existing widget libraries.

Cushy's high-level goals are to be:

- Easy-to-use
- Flexible
- Predictable
- Efficient
- Accessible

Being so early in development, Cushy has not yet achieved all of its goals,
especially with regards to accessibility.
